 * [Module.buildVariant] would be produced.
 *
 * Note : While this implementation should work for most of the cases, this will not generate expected outputs for files
 * whose original module's build variants' name have underscores in them.
 * For example: "feature_a_build_variant-composables.txt"; here expectation is "feature_a" should be the [Module.name]
 * and "build_variant" should be [Module.buildVariant]. But due to the nature of this implementation, "feature_a_build"
 * and "variant" would be [Module.name] and [Module.buildVariant] respectively for this case.
